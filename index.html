			<p>New Cricketer Indian Premier League is a cricket tournament organised by the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) and backed by the International Cricket Council (ICC).[5] For the inaugural tournament held in April–June 2008, the BCCI had finalised a list of 8 teams who will be participating in the tournament. The teams representing 8 different cities of India, including Bangalore, were put up on auction in Mumbai on 20 February 2008 and the Bangalore team was owned by Vijay Mallya, who paid US$111.6 million for it. This was the second highest bid for a team in the IPL, next only to Reliance Industries Ltd.'s bid of $111.9 million for the Mumbai Indians team. Though the franchise failed to justify the price tag at first, they soon rose to popular attention by roping in huge names like Virat Kohli, Chris Gayle, AB de Villiers and others.</p>

			<p>The players in the team (except for Rahul Dravid, who was the Icon Player), were selected in an auction conducted by BCCI on 20 February 2008. South Africa's Jacques Kallis at $900,000 became the costliest player to be selected to play for the Royal Challengers. This meant that Rahul Dravid, being the Icon Player would be paid $1,035,000 (15% more than the highest bid player in the team). Other players selected included the then Indian Test cricket captain Anil Kumble along with his team-mates Praveen Kumar and Zaheer Khan, West Indian Shivnarine Chanderpaul, Aussies Nathan Bracken and Cameron White, South Africa's Mark Boucher (Wicket Keeper) and Dale Steyn. The team also included Pakistan cricket team's vice captain Misbah-ul-Haq although he wasn't in the playing 11 for most part of the tournament.

			In light of financial scandals involving owner/chairman Vijay Mallya, Amrit Thomas became the chairman of the Royal Challengers. RCB changed the team logo and also became the first team in IPL to adopt different jerseys for home and away matches. Virat Kohli, AB de Villiers, Chris Gayle, Mitchell Starc, David Wiese, Adam Milne, Varun Aaron, Mandeep Singh, Harshal Patel, Kedar Jadhav, Sarfaraz Khan, Sreenath Aravind, Yuzvendra Chahal, and Abu Nechim were retained by RCB for the 2016 Indian Premier League. From player auctions, they bought Shane Watson for 9.5 crores, Kane Richardson and Stuart Binny for 2 crores each, and Travis Head and Samuel Badree for 50 lakhs each. Other players that joined the team were Sachin Baby, Iqbal Abdulla, Praveen Dubey, Akshay Karnewar, Vikramjeet Malik and Vikas Tokas. KL Rahul and Parvez Rasool also joined RCB for the IPL 2016 edition. 
			</p>
			<p>Although they won only 2 of their first 7 matches, RCB qualified for the playoffs after finishing with 16 points and secured second place on the points table. They defeated Gujarat Lions in Qualifier 1 and advanced to the final. RCB lost in the finals again, by 8 runs against Sunrisers Hyderabad which was played at their home ground, M. Chinnaswamy Stadium, Bangalore. Both teams reached the 200 run mark but they were 8 runs short of winning the coveted trophy. This is the third defeat for RCB after reaching the finals in the IPL.

		<p>Well absolutely yes. Specially after the way we lost the first Test, we wanted to bounce back hard. Not show anyone but prove ourselves how well we can play. They showed the intent, they showed the belief that we can win from any situation. The snake didn't fall off eventually. There are many important players in the team and they took the responsibility. Today the boys showed their heart and character along with the crowd. A couple of sessions in Test cricket are game changing. The first session on day 2 was game changing. 47 runs only for the loss of 2 wickets. We stopped the momentum for them. From there on we knew, one or two mistakes and we will pick up wickets in every session. The moment they did not get big runs in the first innings, we knew we had a chance in the second innings.</p>
